# Stochastic-Gradient-Langevin-Dynamics
Investigation into the use of kinetic Langevin dynamics in the setting of Bayesian sampling for machine learning.

## Project Planning

### Thoughts

- Computational comparison of stochastic gradient Langevin Dynamics -based approaches with Markov Chain Monte Carlo [7] and Hybrid Monte Carlo methods

#### Existing Models:

- Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics SGLD [@test]

- Modified Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics mSGLD [2]

- Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo SGHMC [3]

- Stochastic Gradient Nose-Hoover Thermostat SGNHT [4]

- Adaptive Langevin thermostat  Ad-Langevin [5]

- Covariance-Controlled Adaptive Langevin CCAdL [6]
